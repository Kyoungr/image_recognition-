This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# CSCI495-C2

## Description / Purpose
The purpose of this project was for me to get my feet wet with building React components and implementing them within a react web application. The longest part of this project was understanding the syntax and how it relates to Javascript. For my job in nashville I will possibly be tasked with building services with React and Javascript so this project helped me gain working experience. I enjoyed using face detecting apis and playing around with different components. 


## Dependencies
- "clarifai": "^2.9.1",
- "nodemon": "^1.19.2",
- "react": "^16.9.0",
- "react-dom": "^16.9.0",
- "react-particles-js": "^2.7.0",
- "react-scripts": "3.1.2",
- "react-tilt": "^0.1.4",
- "tachyons": "^4.11.1"

## Usage
This application makes use of [Clarifia](https://www.clarifai.com/) machine learning models and allows the user to detect a face within an uploaded image. If the user would like to experiment with differnt models then they will need to retrieve an api key from the website which is free. 

## Future Work
This website is responive and visually pleasing but it lacks database connection and an external server. In the future I will store the images uploaded from the user along with user information. I am working on learning new frameworks as a whole but due to the time constrain I was unable to complete everything I had in mind.

## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
I am an Information Technology/Information Systems double major with a full time offer as a software engineer. The company I will be working for along with many other companies use react and javascript for their front end languages. Building this web application allowed me to utilize my critial thinking skills and technical knowlege of software to build a simple but powerful web application. I also aspire to build my own website for my small business and this gave me the oppurtunity test out a possible frontend language.
